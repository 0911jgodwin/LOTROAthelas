This plugin has been designed to replace the default vitals frame with something significantly more stylised.

This new vitals frame can be moved in the same way that the default frame is moved. For most users this is done via the following keyboard shortcut: "CTRL+\".

### Key features:
- Animated player vitals frame.
- Animated class resource frame with custom resource pips. (Supports Brawler, Hunter, Warden, RK, and Champion resources).
- Animated target vitals frame.
- Options panel allowing you to configure the above aspects to your hearts content including scaling of the various frames.
